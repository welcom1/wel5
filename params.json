It is exactly what would be happening to light that falls near the stars. The closer the light goes by, the more the bending effect would be. Like the comets hitting and disintegrating into the sun, there will be light that hits the black hole and gets consumed. There would also be light that is closer enough to be pulled by the black hole but not close enough to be consumed. These beams of lights will have largely varying trajectories. Some beams that were coming towards the earth would even turn back and travel away from earth just like the comets do upon coming closer to the sun.\r\n\r\nThe closer the galaxies are to us, the more that they are going to reflect the cosmic light away from us. This will again hide much of the contents in the universe that we think we know. Again; it is not just light, the X-rays, the gamma rays, the radio waves and photons of any kind would be affected in the same way. We are not allowed to know what is happening out there right now.\r\n\r\nOur own galaxy has a black hole in the centre of it. Anything that we see in that direction that does not belong to our galaxy is not where we think it is. Our black hole is tremendously pulling light and causing curvature in the path of the light. So, all what we see as coming behind our galaxy is not really from behind our galaxy; those are to the sides of galaxy. It is only the light from them are diverted to come to us in a way that we think that the light is coming from right behind the galaxy. And all what seems to be in the sides of our galaxy are not really there because they are too far from us and they are being interacted by too many pieces of masses before reaching us.\r\n\r\nThe only way to find out the real path of light from one star to us would be to know exactly all the masses that are on the way of the light. Our current way of understanding the masses in between involves measuring the light emitted by those stars in some forms always. This only loops it up to us seeing only the past and the illusion of the universe and not the real one.\r\n\r\n \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
